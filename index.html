                <h2>What's it like?</h2>
                The stuttering halt of the train from Delhi at Roorkee is what often comes as the first jolt of realisation. And the schlepping of luggage that follows, accompanied by a babble of old friends reuniting is what lends it that certain credibility. You start walking, inevitably, towards a few of the most memorable of your years. <br> <br>
                True, the initial feelings of trepidation and confusion  (not to mention, annoyance at their lack among your senior counterparts) seem to far outstay their welcome, but there’s no denying the thrill, granted to all freshmen, of stepping into unknown, unbounded realms. <br> <br>
                The first few days on campus are meant, as a principle, to pass in a blur, a phantasmagoria of strange looking people, greek-like lectures and unceasing scurrying between classes, hostels and messes. There’s little that one can do about that. But then someday, when clarity begins to set in, the following words of wisdom are bound to ring true. <br>
                <br>
                Never mind the words of wisdom, what ought to ring true the instant you reawaken your numbed senses are the anecdotes of the incredible history of this institute and the sheer length of its existence. There is also likely to be some unwarranted surprise at the sight of that grand white building, which, you see really does exist, true to the stamp photographs and looking, if anything, even more picturesque in actuality. As campus life unfurls, you’re assured a complete absence of even remotely dull moments.  <br><br>The campus is a living mosaic of a student’s choicest activities. From music, choreography and dramatics for the gifted to Watch Out and Kshitij for the literati to technical sections like Software Development and IMG, the sprawling cultural council leaves nearly no one unconsidered. The Hobbies Club featuring the likes of astronomy, fine arts and philately, the UG Club surfeit with indoor sporting activities and the ever bustling sports complex, all collude to make turn your college life into a never ending celebration, hectic, frenetic, yes, but a celebration all the same. <br>  <br>
                Life on campus comes replete with hedonistic pleasure just as much as it does with academic pressure. While regular exams and assignments do their bit to keep your nose to the grindstone, the snug somnolent town of Roorkee comes with an inherent quality of setting things at just the right pace. With its many eateries and a multitude of hang-out places in and around itself, Roorkee plays the perfect host, offering as good as a break from the rut of the greek-like lectures as you could ask for.

                <h2>Glory Glory IITR!</h2>
                The White Beauty of Roorkee stands tall at a thriving age of 166 years over its other 13 counterparts. Considering all the theories that surround how this college came into being, we strongly feel that we owe our birth to the holy River Ganges. It may sound trivial but without the River Ganges there would have been no canal of that name and without the canal, no college at Roorkee. It was suggested to Sir James Thomason, Lieutenant something-something of North-Westen Province by Colonel Cautley in 1845, also something-something in Royal Artillery and the Superintendent General of Canals since 1836, that there was an immediate need of free wi-fi facilities for the working engineers of canal and if possible then an engineering institution so as to hang around and chat with bright minds kind of stuff. So, after a lot of hurried negotiations and requests to ‘n’ number of Lords of this and that (where n is a large positive integer), involving some blokes in army and uber-cool european engineers, the Roorkee College arose, later to be known as the Thomason College. <br> <br>
                This will also give you an idea why our cult fest is called Thomso. It’s named after Sir James Thomason and not any brand of alcoholic beverage. <br>
                <br>
                The institute has its roots way back in 1845. It was the time when speaking in hard-core british accent was still considered classy and wellington hats were very much in fashion. In 1847 the institute was officially established. It was renamed as the Thomason College of Civil Engineering in 1854 in honour of its founder, Sir James Thomason, lieutenant governor 1843–53. Roorkee pass outs played a role in maintenance of the Ganges canal, construction of dam and irrigation projects like Bhakra Nangal, the Rajasthan canal, the Aswan dam on the Nile in Egypt, and construction of Chandigarh. Apart from all of these creations we also claim Eiffel Tower, Leaning tower of Pisa, Great wall of China and Pyramids of Gizah too. It was us. Believe it or not. <br> <br>
                The Cautley bhawan, named after one of the founding fathers, Colonel Cautley, stands as a reminder of our glorious past. Also to the delight of its residents, there is still wi-fi in Cautley just to honour the Royal artillery colonel. <br> <br>
                It was given the status of University by Act No. IX of 1948 of the United Provinces (Uttar Pradesh) and was titled University of Roorkee. Jawahar Lal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, presented the Charter in November 1949, elevating the erstwhile college to the first engineering university of independent India. It’s not something we brag about. History is never an erudite way to judge anything; as long as you keep learning from it and in your browser’s case, keep deleting it. <br> <br>
                On September 21, 2001, an Ordinance issued by the Government of India declared it as the nation's seventh Indian Institute of Technology. The Ordinance is now converted into an Act by the Parliament to make IIT, Roorkee as an "Institution of National Importance". Well, all we can say is that in recent times, this is one of the more changes to have occurred here. <br> <br>
                The independence struggle of India, the Franco-Prussian war, birth of Germany, I World War, II World War, Partition of India, Rise of Beatles, John Lennon’s murder, Stairway to Heaven, the age of Rock music and the Dark Knight series; the white beauty has beared witness to everything.
